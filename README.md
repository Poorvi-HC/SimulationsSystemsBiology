# Systems Biology Based Simulations

This repository contains all the simulations pertaining to the domain of systems biology. Broadly divided into 2 class of work: `MATLAB simulations` of different phenomenons in Systems Biology & `Paper reprodcution` and presentation associated with it.

##  MATLAB scripts
The MATLAB scripts provided in this repository simulate different cell conditions, capturing a range of cellular responses. The detailed descriptions of each simulation can be found in the report associated with this repository.

## Paper Results reproduction and Biological inferences 
Explore the Jupyter notebook included in this repository to visualize the plots associated with the paper titled **"A positive-feedback-based bistable ‘memory module’ that governs a cell fate decision" by Wen Xiong & James E. Ferrell Jr** from the Department of Molecular Pharmacology at Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA. The notebook also includes inferences obtained for different threshold conditions.
